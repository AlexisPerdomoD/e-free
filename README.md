###
## Requirements
E-free requires Node install in your work enviroment and at least a MongoDB connection able to be use. Don't worry about the collections, the api would create them with as soon it have access to de connection url.

#### Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env.production or .env.develoment file in the src directory.

*  `PORT` reference to the por where the api is running.

*   `DB` e-free uses mongose to connect with mongodb so DB is the url connection provided by your mongo database provider, more details of the connection can be found in the connectionDB.js file in the utils directory and here is [more information about mongose conection config](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/connection.html)

* `SECRET` used for sign cookies and sessions so be careful about it

* `HOST` reference the host where the app is running

*`PERSISTENCE` includes 'FS'(file system) making use of a json file 'products.json' next to 'ProductMannager.js' file in the productMannager directory inside DAO directory. if you want to make use of this file for including your own products you can do it. The other option for PERSISTENCE is 'MONGO' that will connect with MONGODB with a diferent productMannager.

*  `MODE` there is 'DEV'(development) with more debug information, persistence mode in file system for products(JSon file) and 'PRO'(production) with persistence mode in mongodb for everything. This is for debug information purposes. 

#### example .dev.develoment
```
PORT = 8080
// connection string template provide by mongo atlas
DB = mongodb+srv://username:***********@clutster0.*******.mongodb.net/e-comerse-server
SECRET = secret
HOST = http://localhost:8080
PERSISTENCE = FS
MODE = DEV
```
